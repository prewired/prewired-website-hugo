We're always looking for more helpers!

Helping young people learn to code is hugely rewarding. If you can offer your time for two hours on a [Wednesday evening](/what-we-do#where--when), we’d love to hear from you! We run them pretty much throughout the year, with some breaks during Christmas and Easter. We also hold an annual Summer Hack &mdash; a one-week team-based hackathon. 

#### Joining

If you are interested in volunteering with Prewired, please drop us an email: hello@prewired.org.

Let us know a bit about your background and reason for joining! We'll offer a quick chat about how we work and get you started with the Disclosure process.

###### PVG Disclosure

All volunteers are required to complete a [PVG Disclosure](https://www.mygov.scot/pvg-scheme) and register it with Prewired. We will guide you through the associated paperwork, and costs are covered by [Volunteer Scotland](https://www.volunteerscotland.net/). If you already have a PVG Disclosure you will still need to register it with us.

            Prewired is largely unstructured and our main goal is to support the young people in learning whatever it is they want to learn. So volunteering at Prewired consists mostly of wandering around a room full of budding hackers, answering questions, helping to fix bugs, and actively checking on the kids to make sure they’re happy and learning. You don’t need to come every week, but it’s helpful for the kids to have some consistency, so we’d love it if you could come as often as possible.
