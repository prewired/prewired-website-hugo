#### What makes Prewired different

Prewired differs from our partner organisations by providing an encouraging, yet unstructured environment for attendees to explore their personal interests in technology, rather than through prepared workshops or classes. We've found that many young people enjoy investigating technology at their own pace, or maybe go down more niche paths which we wouldn't cover in a workshop! We've had attendees:

- Create digital music using Raspberry Pis
- Create Source Engine maps with Hammer
- Programming Lego Mindstorm robots (we have a few)
- Investigate programming a bare-bones OS from scratch (not easy!)

Occasionally we do run structured **workshops** to introduce attendees to a new topic they may not have considered before. Over the summer we sometimes hold **hackathons**, where the kids are challenged to meet specific goals in a set amount of time; this is a really fun learning experience, with concrete outcomes. In the past, we have formed teams to take part in national **events** like [the First Lego League](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) or [Young Rewired State](https://yrs.io).

Prewired is also a place for young people to **meet peers** with shared interests which they can develop together. For some, it can be difficult to interest friends and family in computing, which may lead to a feeling of isolation. It can be hard to figure out where to go next when there's no-one you can ask. We want to let young people know that there's a **huge community** of like-minded people who are waiting to welcome them.

#### Who is Prewired for

<div class="split justify-content-start align-items-start">
    <div class="split-piece split-50">
        <p style="padding-left: 0">
            If you/your child has shown an interest in learning to code, or just always seems to be on the computer, then there's a lot to get out of Prewired.<br><br>
            We have no lower limit on age or ability, so long as attendees are enthusiastic about coding and comfortable learning independently or in a semi-supervised way with a computer. <br><br>
            Please note, we don't have the capacity to look after very young children who are not able to engage.

#### Session rundown

At the start each session we'll ask attendees (and guardians if attending) to sign in at the door with a volunteer. We'll ask your name and check you off on our attendee list. Please make sure you've registered for the session in advance.

If you're new, please let us know! One of our volunteers will explain how the session works and get you set up with a laptop if needed. They'll help you find a place to sit and make sure you've got an idea of what you want to get stuck into.

Our space in CodeBase is sizeable enough to sit with others, or apart, if that's your preference.

We'll typically take a break to provide juice and snacks, but otherwise the session time is free for attendees to work on what they'd like with our volunteers floating around to answer questions and provide support.

#### Where & when?

We meet at at:

[CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com)<br>
37A Castle Terrace<br>
Edinburgh<br>
EH3 9DZ<br>

Every Wednesday 5.30&ndash;7.30 pm, with exceptions for Christmas holidays and New Year.

#### I'm a guardian, do I need to come with my child?

**If your child is younger than 11**: Yes, you must accompany your child throughout every Prewired session that they attend. If your child is very young and needs lots of support, you should be prepared to sit with them to help. You can of course ask a volunteer for technical advice.

**If your child is 11 or older**: It is up to you. You are welcome to accompany your child if you think this would benefit them. They will otherwise be fully supervised at all times by volunteers from local community groups, companies and universities.

#### What should attendees bring?

We have plenty of laptops that attendees can borrow, but you're welcome to bring their own computers. If an attendee has other pieces of electronic technology (e.g., Raspberry Pis, Arduino kits, Lego Mindstorms, entire servers...) they want to tinker with, they can bring them along! 

For more information about ways to get started with coding, see our [resources page](/resources).

We'll provide fruit juice and a few snacks half-way through the session. 

#### How much does it cost?

Nothing! Prewired is free, run by volunteers, supported by donations from local companies.
